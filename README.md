# Blockchain platform for issuing and verifying HigherEducation diplomas

Thesis project that is using Hyperledger fabric as a private blockchain and IPFS as distributed file storage for issuing and verifying Higher Education Institutions diplomas. You can check the full research report [here](https://github.com/awfulwaffle77/blockchain-diplomas/blob/master/Research_report.pdf).

## Proposed architecture so far

An institution issues diploma in digital format for every student and stores it as a .pdf file.
Then, students create a public-private key pair and send the public key to the institution, while
safely storing the private key. The institution uses the API, which hashes diploma, then uploads
the hash on the Hyperledger blockchain. The API also encrypts diploma with the specific
student’s public key, then uploads it on the IPFS network. The returned hash ID is then stored
to the student’s wallet. From this point on, if a student has access to his private key, he also has
access to his wallet, where he can get the hash IDs of the documents that are issued to him.
With those hashes, he can request to download the encrypted diploma from the IPFS network.
The encrypted diploma can be then decrypted with his private key and hashed. Lastly, the hash
can be validated on the blockchain. This last step can be made by anyone who possesses the
hash and who knows what it represents. A student can also choose to share the diploma with a
third party so the third party can check by itself.

## Privacy concerns 

Storing diplomas on a distributed systems like this one may represent a privacy issue, as anyone could access your diploma. The proposed solution is that a public-private key is generated by every student. Their public keys are requested and would be used by the institution. The diplomas would be encrypted with their public key and they could retrieve the diploma from the IPFS network and decrypt it with their own key.
